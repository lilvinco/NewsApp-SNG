# My Notes App
This is my note app
This is the first activity that opens.
The button is clicked to start creating your notes.

I changed my action bar to a collapsing toolbar which has an overflow menu with an option to delet all your notes and back button to return to the first activity and also a FAB(Floating Action Bar) to add a new note. To delete one app at a time, you can swipe left or right.

This is my create note activity where you add the title of your note and the content, then save the note.
